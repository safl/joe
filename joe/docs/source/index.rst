==================================================
 cijoe: tools for systems development and testing
==================================================

**cijoe** is a means to collect, and loosely formalize, the bits and pieces
commonly used during systems development in order to obtain an **automated**
and **reproducible** workflow.

Quickstart
==========

The following will install **cijoe**, produce a default configuration, and an
example workflow, and execute the workflow using the configuration, and lastly
produce a workflow-report:

.. literalinclude:: 200_quickstart.cmd
   :language: bash

.. literalinclude:: 100_example.cmd
   :language: bash

For a thorough description, the rest of the documentation is provided with the
:ref:`sec-introduction` serving as the starting point.
