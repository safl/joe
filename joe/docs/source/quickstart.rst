 Quick Start
=============

Run the following commands in your shell:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Install CIJOE and the CIJOE example package
  python3 -m pip install --user cijoe cijoe-pkg-example

  # Run the example workflow, locally
  python3 -m joe.cli run example

  # Inspect the report
  xdg-open cijoe*/report.html

In case the above did not work for you, or you just want to know what went on
above, or you want to know what else you can do with **cijoe**, or whatever
your motivation is, then the rest of the documentation should be able to answer
your questions.

The :ref:`sec-introduction` serves as the starting point, defining some terms
and information which will be used throughout the documentation and providing
an overview of the remaining sections.
