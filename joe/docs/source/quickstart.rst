 Quick Start
=============

Run the following commands in your shell:

.. code-block:: bash

  # Install CIJOE
  python3 -m pip install --user cijoe

  # Create a default configuration and workflow
  joe -s

  # Run the example workflow, locally
  joe

.. NOTE: In case 'joe' is not found. Then you can run it via ``python3 -m joe.cli``

In case the above did not work for you, or you just want to know what went on
above, or you want to know what else you can do with **cijoe**, or whatever
your motivation is, then the rest of the documentation should be able to answer
your questions.

The :ref:`sec-introduction` serves as the starting point, defining some terms
and information which will be used throughout the documentation and providing
an overview of the remaining sections.
