 cijoe: tools for systems development and testing
==================================================

**cijoe** is a means to collect, and loosely formalize, the bits and pieces
commonly used during systems development in order to obtain an **automated**
and **reproducible** workflow. **cijoe** comes in handy regardless of whether
your development environment consist of a single machine, a collection of
locally available hardware resources, virtual machines, integrated **CI/CD**
pipelines, or a mixture thereof.

The :ref:`sec-quickstart` section is provided for the impatient reader. For a
thorough description, the rest of the documentation is provided with the
:ref:`sec-introduction` serving as the starting point.
